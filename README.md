# Socail Network Analysis Project
### Antonin Thioux and Niek Loke
This is a private repo for working on the socail network analysis project (2022-2023).

Deliverables:
 - Code
 - Report ([link to overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/4423289449gsjkvkxrsscd))

## Instructions:
### Network statistics - Metrices
Calculate the metrics and measures discussed:
number of vertices, number of edges, degree distribution (in-degree and out degree), centrality indices, clustering coefficient, network diameter, density, number of connected components and, size of the connected components.

### Communites
Identify groups and their structure:
 - Cliques
 - Homophily analysis
 - Important nodes acting as Bridges
 - Partitioning Algorithm: Girvan-Newman

### HITS
algorithm, rank nodes by hub and authority scores (or PageRank, by choice)

### Longitudinal analysis
e.g., how did the following relationship change on Twitter, in intervals of choice depending on the dataset -> ego network

### Visualize
Visualize the graphs.
To make sense of the data more easily, map the metrics onto properties such as size, colorâ€¦

### Discussion and conclusions
What questions can be answered by analyzing the chosen networks/datasets? 
What nodes are in strategic locations?
What can be interpreted about the communities you have detected?
Interpret and discuss your findings.
